['Es war einmal mitten im Winter, und die Schneeflocken fielen wie Federn vom Himmel herab. Da saß eine Königin an einem Fenster, das einen Rahmen von schwarzem Ebenholz hatte, und nähte. Und wie sie so nähte und nach dem Schnee aufblickte, stach sie sich mit der Nadel in den Finger, und es fielen drei Tropfen Blut in den Schnee. ',
"Und weil das Rote im weißen Schnee so schön aussah, dachte sie bei sich: Hätt' ich ein Kind, so weiß wie Schnee, so rot wie Blut und so schwarz wie das Holz an dem Rahmen! Bald darauf bekam sie ein Töchterlein, das war so weiß wie Schnee, so rot wie Blut und so schwarzhaarig wie Ebenholz und ward darum Schneewittchen (Schneeweißchen) genannt. ",
'Und wie das Kind geboren war, starb die Königin. Über ein Jahr nahm sich der König eine andere Gemahlin. Es war eine schöne Frau, aber sie war stolz und übermütig und konnte nicht leiden, daß sie an Schönheit von jemand sollte übertroffen werden. ',
'Sie hatte einen wunderbaren Spiegel; wenn sie vor den trat und sich darin beschaute, sprach sie: "Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand, Wer ist die Schönste im ganzen Land?" so antwortete der Spiegel: "Frau Königin, Ihr seid die Schönste im Land."',
"Da war sie zufrieden, denn sie wußte, daß der Spiegel die Wahrheit sagte. Schneewittchen aber wuchs heran und wurde immer schöner, und als es sieben Jahre alt war, war es so schön, wie der klare Tag und schöner als die Königin selbst. Als diese einmal ihren Spiegel fragte: "

["'Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand, Wer ist die Schönste im ganzen Land?' so antwortete er: 'Frau Königin, Ihr seid die Schönste hier, Aber Schneewittchen ist tausendmal schöner als Ihr.' Da erschrak die Königin und ward gelb und grün vor Neid. ",
"Von Stund an, wenn sie Schneewittchen erblickte, kehrte sich ihr das Herz im Leibe herum, so haßte sie das Mädchen. ",
'Und der Neid und Hochmut wuchsen wie ein Unkraut in ihrem Herzen immer höher, daß sie Tag und Nacht keine Ruhe mehr hatte. Da rief sie einen Jäger und sprach: "Bring das Kind hinaus in den Wald, ich will\'s nicht mehr vor meinen Augen sehen. Du sollst es töten und mir Lunge und Leber zum Wahrzeichen mitbringen." ',
"Der Jäger gehorchte und führte es hinaus, und als er den Hirschfänger gezogen hatte und Schneewittchens unschuldiges Herz durchbohren wollte, fing es an zu weinen und sprach: 'Ach, lieber Jäger, laß mir mein Leben! Ich will in den wilden Wald laufen und nimmermehr wieder heimkommen.' ",
"Und weil es gar so schön war, hatte der Jäger Mitleiden und sprach: 'So lauf hin, du armes Kind!' Die wilden Tiere werden dich bald gefressen haben, dachte er, und doch war's ihm, als wäre ein Stein von seinem Herzen gewälzt, weil er es nicht zu töten brauchte. "

["Und als gerade ein junger Frischling dahergesprungen kam, stach er ihn ab, nahm Lunge und Leber heraus und brachte sie als Wahrzeichen der Königin mit. Der Koch mußte sie in Salz kochen, und das boshafte Weib aß sie auf und meinte, sie hätte Schneewittchens Lunge und Leber gegessen. ",
"Nun war das arme Kind in dem großen Wald mutterseelenallein, und ward ihm so angst, daß es alle Blätter an den Bäumen ansah und nicht wußte, wie es sich helfen sollte. ",
"Da fing es an zu laufen und lief über die spitzen Steine und durch die Dornen, und die wilden Tiere sprangen an ihm vorbei, aber sie taten ihm nichts. Es lief, so lange nur die Füße noch fortkonnten, bis es bald Abend werden wollte. ",
"Da sah es ein kleines Häuschen und ging hinein, sich zu ruhen. In dem Häuschen war alles klein, aber so zierlich und reinlich, daß es nicht zu sagen ist. Da stand ein weißgedecktes Tischlein mit sieben kleinen Tellern, jedes Tellerlein mit seinem Löffelein, ferner sieben Messerlein und Gäblelein und sieben Becherlein. ",
"An der Wand waren sieben Bettlein nebeneinander aufgestellt und schneeweiße Laken darüber gedeckt. Schneewittchen, weil es so hungrig und durstig war, aß von jedem Tellerlein ein wenig Gemüs' und Brot und trank aus jedem Becherlein einen Tropfen Wein; "]],#4

["denn es wollte nicht einem alles wegnehmen. Hernach, weil es so müde war, legte es sich in ein Bettchen, aber keins paßte; das eine war zu lang, das andere zu kurz, bis endlich das siebente recht war; und darin blieb es liegen, befahl sich Gott und schlief ein.",
"Als es ganz dunkel geworden war, kamen die Herren von dem Häuslein, das waren die sieben Zwerge, die in den Bergen nach Erz hackten und gruben. Sie zündeten ihre sieben Lichtlein an, und wie es nun hell im Häuslein ward, sahen sie, daß jemand darin gesessen war, denn es stand nicht alles so in der Ordnung, wie sie es verlassen hatten.",
"Der erste sprach: 'Wer hat auf meinem Stühlchen gesessen?' Der zweite: 'Wer hat von meinem Tellerchen gegessen?' Der dritte: »Wer hat von meinem Brötchen genommen?' ",
"Der vierte: 'Wer hat von meinem Gemüschen gegessen?' Der fünfte: 'Wer hat mit meinem Gäbelchen gestochen?' Der sechste: 'Wer hat mit meinem Messerchen geschnitten?' Der siebente: 'Wer hat aus meinem Becherlein getrunken?' ",

['And as Cinderella wept at this, the step-mother said, "If thou canst pick two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, thou shalt go with us." And she thought to herself, "That she most certainly cannot do." ',
'When the step-mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the ashes, the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and cried, You tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds under heaven, come and help me to pick "The good into the pot, The bad into the crop." ',
'Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at length all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. ',
'And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an hour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again. ',
'Then the maiden carried the dishes to the step-mother and was delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the festival. But the step-mother said, "All this will not help thee; thou goest not with us, for thou hast no clothes and canst not dance; we should be ashamed of thee!"'

[[1,1,1,1,1],
['On this she turned her back on Cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters. ',
'As no one was now at home, Cinderella went to her mother\'s grave beneath the hazel-tree, and cried, "Shiver and quiver, little tree, Silver and gold throw down over me." ',#'
'Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She put on the dress with all speed, and went to the festival. ',
'Her step-sisters and the step-mother however did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought of Cinderella, and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes. ',
'The prince went to meet her, took her by the hand and danced with her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never left loose of her hand, and if any one else came to invite her, he said, "This is my partner."'
]],#7
[[1,1,1,1,1],
['She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the King\'s son said, "I will go with thee and bear thee company," for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged. ', #' 
"She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon-house. The King's son waited until her father came, and then he told him that the stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house. ", 
'The old man thought, "Can it be Cinderella?" and they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it. ',
'And when they got home Cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and a dim little oil lamp was burning on the mantle-piece, ',
'for Cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house and had run to the little hazeltree, and there she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again, and then she had placed herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes in her grey gown.'

[[1,1,1,1,1],
['Next day when the festival began afresh, and her parents and the stepsisters had gone once more, Cinderella went to the hazel-tree and said- "Shiver and quiver, my little tree, Silver and gold throw down over me." ',
"Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day. And when Cinderella appeared at the festival in this dress, every one was astonished at her beauty. The King's son had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her. ",
'When others came and invited her, he said, "She is my partner." When evening came she wished to leave, and the King\'s son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went. But she sprang away from him, and into the garden behind the house. Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears. ',
'She clambered so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the King\'s son did not know where she was gone. He waited until her father came, and said to him, "The stranger-maiden has escaped from me, and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree." The father thought, "Can it be Cinderella?" and had an axe brought and cut the tree down, but no one was on it. ', #'
'And when they got into the kitchen, Cinderella lay there amongst the ashes, as usual, for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and put on her grey gown.'

[[1,1,1,1,1],
['On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away, Cinderella went once more to her mother\'s grave and said to the little tree- "Shiver and quiver, my little tree, Silver and gold throw down over me." ' #'
"And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were golden. And when she went to the festival in the dress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment. The King's son danced with her only, and if any one invited her to dance, he said, \"She is my partner.\" ",
"When evening came, Cinderella wished to leave, and the King's son was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her. The King's son had, however, used a strategem, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maiden's left slipper remained sticking. ",
"The King's son picked it up, and it was small and dainty, and all golden. Next morning, he went with it to the father, and said to him, \"No one shall be my wife but she whose foot this golden slipper fits.\" Then were the two sisters glad, for they had pretty feet. The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by. ",
"But she could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a knife and said, \"Cut the toe off; when thou art Queen thou wilt have no more need to go on foot.\" The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the King's son. Then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her."

[[1,1,1,1,1],
["They were, however, obliged to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree, sat the two pigeons and cried, \"Turn and peep, turn and peep, There's blood within the shoe, The shoe it is too small for her, The true bride waits for you.\" ", #'
'Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was streaming from it. He turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, and said she was not the true one, and that the other sister was to put the shoe on. Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was too large. So her mother gave her a knife and said, "Cut a bit off thy heel; when thou art Queen thou wilt have no more need to go on foot." ',
"The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the King's son. He took her on his horse as his bride, and rode away with her, but when they passed by the hazel-tree, two little pigeons sat on it and cried, \"Turn and peep, turn and peep, There's blood within the shoe, The shoe it is too small for her, The true bride waits for you.\" ", #'
'He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking. Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again. "This also is not the right one," said he, "have you no other daughter?" "No," said the man, "There is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the bride." ',
"The King's son said he was to send her up to him; but the mother answered, \"Oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself!\" He absolutely insisted on it, and Cinderella had to be called. She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the King's son, who gave her the golden shoe. Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove."

[[1,1,1,1,1],
["And when she rose up and the King's son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him and cried, \"That is the true bride!\" The stepmother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with rage; he, however, took Cinderella on his horse and rode away with her. As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried- ", 
'"Turn and peep, turn and peep, No blood is in the shoe, The shoe is not too small for her, The true bride rides with you," and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed themselves on Cinderella\'s shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there. ', #'
"When the wedding with the King's son had to be celebrated, the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favour with Cinderella and share her good fortune. When the betrothed couple went to church, the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye of each of them. Afterwards as they came back, the elder was at the left, and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye of each. ",
"And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they lived. ",
